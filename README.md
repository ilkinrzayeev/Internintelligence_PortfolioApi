# Portfolio API Development

## Overview
This is a RESTful API for managing user portfolios. It allows users to store, manage, and showcase their portfolios, including details like projects, skills, experience, and education. The API supports CRUD operations and includes JWT-based authentication for secure access. Each user can only modify their own portfolio data to ensure privacy and security.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete portfolio entries.
- **Authorization**: Users can only access and modify their own portfolio data.
- **Data Security**: Secure handling of user credentials and portfolio data.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user account.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in to get a JWT token for authentication.

### Portfolio Management
- `GET /api/portfolio`: Retrieve the authenticated user's portfolio data.
- `POST /api/portfolio`: Create a new portfolio entry for the authenticated user.
- `PUT /api/portfolio`: Update an existing portfolio entry for the authenticated user.
- `DELETE /api/portfolio`: Delete a portfolio entry for the authenticated user.

## Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used to authenticate users.
- After successful login, the user will receive a JWT token, which should be included in the `Authorization` header in subsequent requests to protected routes.

## Authorization
- Each user can only modify or delete their own portfolio data.
- The JWT token is verified in each request to ensure users can only interact with their own information.

## Pros
- **Portfolio Management**: Users can easily create, update, and showcase their professional portfolios.
- **Security**: JWT authentication ensures that the application is secure and only authorized users can access or modify their data.

## Cons
- **Complexity**: Setting up secure user authentication and managing JWT tokens can be complex.
- **Scalability**: The API might require optimization and scaling considerations as the number of users and requests grows.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- A database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) for storing user data and portfolio entries

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-api.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-api
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. Add the necessary configuration, such as your database credentials and JWT secret.

5. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The API will now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you configure).
